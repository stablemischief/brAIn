## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### **This Session - Security Architecture**
1. **Multi-layered Security Approach**
   - Defense in depth: WAF → API Gateway → Application → Database
   - Comprehensive security controls at each layer
   - Zero-trust authentication and authorization

2. **Security Testing Framework**
   - Automated vulnerability testing with pytest
   - Comprehensive test coverage for OWASP Top 10
   - Integration-ready security test suites

3. **GDPR Compliance Framework**
   - Data subject rights implementation patterns
   - Privacy by design architectural principles
   - Comprehensive consent management system design

### **Critical Security Findings**
- **Authentication System Broken:** JWT signature validation disabled
- **Mock Authentication:** Production code accepts any token
- **CORS Misconfiguration:** Wildcard origins allowed
- **Input Validation Missing:** SQL/XSS injection vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Exposure:** Hardcoded credentials in source code

### **Technical Patterns Established**
- **Security-First Development:** Comprehensive security guidelines
