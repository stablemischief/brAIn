# SESSION RECOVERY PROTOCOL - brAIn v2.0

## ðŸ”„ **MANDATORY Session Recovery Sequence**

**USE THIS FOR EVERY SESSION RESTART**

### **Step 1: Activate BMAD Team**
```
/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator *party-mode
```

**NOTE**: If party-mode doesn't activate the full team automatically, explicitly request:
"Please bring in the full BMAD team for this session - Winston, Sam, Quinn, and John."

### **Step 2: Read Critical Documents (IN ORDER)**
1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project constraints, compliance protocols, architecture patterns
2. **SESSION-HANDOFF.md** - Current mission status, last session results, next actions
3. **BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md** - Current phase status, task details, progress tracking

### **Step 3: Validate Current State**
- Check git status for recent commits
- Verify current phase from BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md
- Confirm session handoff point is accurate
- Identify next task to begin

### **Step 4: Begin Work with Compliance**
- Use compliance indicators: `ðŸŽ¯ BMAD-Archon: [ACTION] | Task: [ID] | Status: [STATUS]`
- Start with documented next action
- Update progress in BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md as work proceeds

## ðŸ“Š **Current Project State Quick Reference**

### **Mission**: brAIn v2.0 System Integration Audit
- **Status**: Phase 5 Required - System Integration Issues
- **Problem**: Installer infinite loops, import structure inconsistencies
- **Impact**: System works for developers, NOT for users
- **Next**: Phase 5.1 - Import Structure Standardization

### **Context**:
- Phases 1-4 (MVP Core): COMPLETED âœ…
- Phase 5 (User Integration): Required for user-ready state
- User testing revealed fundamental integration problems

## ðŸŽ¯ **Session Recovery Validation Checklist**

Before starting ANY development work:

- [ ] BMAD Team activated via command
- [ ] All three critical documents read and understood
- [ ] Current phase and task identified from BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md
- [ ] Git status checked for latest commits
- [ ] Compliance indicator format confirmed
- [ ] Next action clearly identified

### **Red Flags - STOP if you see:**
- No clear next action in BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md
- Confusion about current phase or task
- Missing context about previous session work
- Uncertain about problem being solved

---

## ðŸš¨ **Emergency Context Recovery**

If session context is unclear:

1. **Read SESSION-HANDOFF.md completely**
2. **Check latest git commits**: `git log -5 --oneline`
3. **Review current BMAD-FIX-PLAN.md status**
4. **If still unclear**: STOP and request clarification

---

**This protocol ensures EVERY session starts with complete context and clear direction.**
