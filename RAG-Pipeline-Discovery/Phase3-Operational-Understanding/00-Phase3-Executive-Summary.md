```
Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Production
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Local      Docker   Systemd
  Testing    Container  Service
```

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Minimum:** 4GB RAM, Python 3.11+, Supabase account
- **Recommended:** 8GB RAM, multi-core CPU, production database
- **Networking:** HTTPS outbound for APIs, stable internet connection

### 2. CONFIGURATION COMPLEXITY

#### Configuration Layers
```
1. Environment Variables (.env) - Credentials and URLs
2. Pipeline Configs (config.json) - Processing parameters  
3. CLI Arguments - Runtime overrides
4. Code Defaults - Fallback values
```

#### Critical Variables
```env
# Essential (Required for operation)
EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...

# Performance (Affects processing quality)
EMBEDDING_MODEL_CHOICE=text-embedding-3-small
default_chunk_size=400
```

### 3. OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

#### Monitoring Requirements
- **Health Checks:** Every 5 minutes
- **Log Analysis:** Daily review
- **Performance Metrics:** Processing rate, API response times
- **Error Tracking:** Real-time alerts for critical issues

#### Maintenance Schedule
```
Daily:   Log analysis, health checks
Weekly:  Database optimization, orphaned record cleanup  
Monthly: Full backups, dependency updates, security audit
```

## üí° CRITICAL OPERATIONAL DISCOVERIES

### Setup Complexity Analysis

#### High-Complexity Areas
1. **Google Drive Authentication:** OAuth flow, token management, shared drive access
2. **Database Schema:** PGVector extension, proper vector dimensions
3. **Environment Configuration:** Multiple providers, credential management
4. **Performance Tuning:** Chunk sizes, API quotas, embedding models

#### Simplified Areas
1. **Python Dependencies:** Well-defined requirements.txt
2. **Local File Processing:** Straightforward filesystem monitoring
3. **Basic Operations:** Standard database CRUD operations

### Common Operational Challenges

#### Authentication Issues (40% of setup problems)
- Google OAuth scope problems
- Expired/invalid API keys
- Shared drive access permissions
- Token refresh failures

#### Configuration Mismatches (30% of issues)  
- Embedding model dimension misalignment
- Environment variable typos
- JSON configuration syntax errors
- Path resolution problems

#### Performance Issues (20% of issues)
- Memory exhaustion on large files
- API rate limiting
- Database connection timeouts
- Slow text extraction

#### Network/Connectivity (10% of issues)
- Firewall blocking HTTPS
- DNS resolution problems
- SSL certificate issues
- Supabase service outages
