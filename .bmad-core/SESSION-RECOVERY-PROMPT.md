ðŸ”„ **BMAD PROACTIVE SESSION RECOVERY - ENHANCED PROTOCOL**

CONTEXT: This is a planned session restart following BMAD Enhanced Proactive Session Management. Previous session ended cleanly with full handoff documentation.

IMMEDIATE SEQUENCE:
1. `/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator` - Activate BMAD team
2. Execute comprehensive project health assessment
3. Validate session handoff documentation
4. Resume from documented state

PROJECT HEALTH ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:
â–¡ Read CLAUDE.md for project constraints & architecture
â–¡ Check SESSION-HANDOFF.md for last session state
â–¡ Validate Archon MCP task status and synchronization
â–¡ Review recent git commits for compliance violations
â–¡ Check code against established patterns and standards
â–¡ Verify all tests passing and no technical debt introduced
â–¡ Assess any compression-gap changes or drift

BMAD TEAM ACTIVATION PROTOCOL:
- Full context restoration from handoff documentation
- Validate project state matches documented expectations
- Check for any "Claude chaos" changes during gap
- Create remediation plan for any issues discovered
- Resume development from validated, clean state

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
âœ… BMAD team successfully activated and contextually aware
âœ… Project state validated against handoff documentation
âœ… Archon task system synchronized and current
âœ… No compliance violations or architecture drift detected
âœ… All tests passing and code quality maintained
âœ… Ready to resume productive development

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT: 
All actions must use: ðŸŽ¯ BMAD-Archon: [ACTION] | Task: [ID] | Status: [STATUS]

DO NOT proceed with new development until all validation criteria are met and any issues are resolved.

## PROACTIVE HANDOFF CHECKLIST

Use this before ending any session to ensure clean transitions:

### PRE-SESSION-END PROTOCOL

**1. Complete Current Work Cleanly**
- [ ] Finish current task completely (no partial implementations)
- [ ] All code compiles and basic functionality tested
- [ ] All files saved and consistent
- [ ] No hanging commits or unstaged changes

**2. Update All Tracking Systems**
- [ ] Update Archon task status to accurate state
- [ ] Commit all changes with meaningful messages
- [ ] Update any progress documentation
- [ ] Note any blockers or dependencies

**3. Create Session Handoff Documentation**
- [ ] Generate SESSION-HANDOFF.md with current state
- [ ] Document next priority tasks
- [ ] Note any architectural decisions or context
- [ ] List any known issues or technical debt

**4. Validation Before Exit**
- [ ] Run test suite to ensure stability
- [ ] Check for any linting or compliance violations
- [ ] Verify git status is clean
- [ ] Confirm Archon synchronization

### SESSION-HANDOFF.md TEMPLATE

The system will automatically generate this file before session end with:

- **Session Summary**: What was accomplished
- **Current State**: Exact project state and active work
- **Next Priorities**: Specific tasks queued for next session
- **Blockers/Dependencies**: Anything that might affect next session
- **Architectural Notes**: Any decisions or patterns established
- **Validation Status**: Test results, code quality checks
- **Archon Synchronization**: Task IDs and current status
