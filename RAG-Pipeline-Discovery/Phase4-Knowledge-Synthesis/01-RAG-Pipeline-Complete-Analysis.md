## 1. TOOL OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

### What This Tool Actually Does
The RAG Pipeline is a **document vectorization system** that:
- Monitors document sources (Google Drive folders or local directories)
- Extracts text from various file formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.)
- Converts text into vector embeddings using AI models
- Stores everything in a searchable vector database
- Keeps the database synchronized with document changes

### Core Value Delivered
**Transforms document collections into AI-searchable knowledge bases** - takes your files and makes them available for semantic search and AI retrieval.

### Primary Use Case
**Knowledge base preparation for AI agents** - provides the foundational data layer that enables AI systems to search and retrieve relevant information from your document collections.
